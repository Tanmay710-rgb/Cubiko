# Cubiko

This repository contains a basic game developed in Unity.

This is a single-player 3D game featuring a box character under the player's control, set against a backdrop of numerous box obstacles scattered across an endless plane. The objective is to navigate the character through these obstacles.

To enhance the engagement supplementary features, including a real-time scoreboard to monitor your progress and a versatile Play/Pause button are added.

## Playing Criteria
-> If the player falls off the plane or collides with any obstacle before reaching the finish line, level instantly restarts.

-> If the player reaches the finish line he/she will advances to the next level.
